                <p class="description">everything but the crystal goblet reader was a project that we were assigned to in my Typography class in my sophomore year. For the project, we had to collect past readings and compile it into a printed book, having a connection with one another through their themes. The reading I chose was ******************The Crystal Goblet****************** by Beatrice Warde, which describes typography and design as a vessel that enhances the content, and should not do anything to steal the “spotlight” of the content itself. I chose this article and decided to compile it with three other readings that go against exactly what she intends to express, because I personally don’t fully agree with what the piece has to say. 

                    There are two parts to this reading reader. The first is a small square book that is just the chapter where Warde explains her concept of typography as a crystal goblet, except I inserted graphic designs every other page and printed the texts on vellum paper so the designs are constantly permeating the texts. In a way, this contradicts everything she’s trying to convey in her text because the text becomes a decorative vessel for the designs. The second part consists of the three other articles that contradict the Crystal Goblet ideology and is printed with risograph. The texts in the articles are the only part of the entire spread that is not printed with the risograph ink, while the surrounding regions are graphic elements that embellish and sets off the text. The two parts of the reader are then combined into one piece with a spiral binding. 
                    
                    I actually had a lot of fun making this piece and it’s kinda the only piece that I won’t shut up about. I remember when I first chose the Crystal Goblet reading, I only chose it because I thought it would be so fun to create crystal-like translucent graphic elements, and I didn’t fully comprehend the text. It was really interesting to see the evolution of this project because it was pretty apparent that I initially don’t really have my concepts grounded and just wanted to do my own thing, but the more I read into it and thought about it, the more I’m realizing there’s a bigger message behind these readings. I also had a lot of fun experimenting with different media and materials with this project and I remember actually enjoying the process of creating this, which I think is pretty rare. 
                    
                    I think this work in specific really isn’t inspired by one artist, or anyone that I can really think of and name right now. However, I think it’s more of an amalgamation of different inspirations of current trends that are pretty prevalent in modern print media. For example, the use of bitmaps and risograph printing are just a few examples that I think a lot of designers are implementing in their work right now. The use of noisy gradients that I implemented in the graphic elements of the book are also quite popular in design trends now.
